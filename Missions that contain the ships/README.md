# Missions that contain the ships from <cite>Descent Online</cite>
These missions feature models for the Tigg SB and Agressor Prime. Based on how they look compared to [these pictures](https://web.archive.org/web/20041207101600/http://archives.descent.cx/d1/do.html), I would say that the models are pretty much the same as the ones that were originally included in <cite>Descent Online</cite>.
